# Bulk Discounts 

This project is an extension of the Little Esty Shop group project. Added functionality for merchants to create bulk discounts for their items. A “bulk discount” is a discount based on the quantity of items the customer is buying, for example “20% off orders of 10 or more items”. 

## Learning Goals 

* Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
* Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
* Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
* Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
